Data collected by undergraduate assistants to Prof John Smith at the Berkeley	Field Station. All plants were located in Field 3 and chosen for measurement when approximately 12" tall. Yields were recorded in August 2015.
Field codes indicate no treatment (N), conventional (C), and organic (O). Yield is in kg, with NA indicating a plant that	died prior to yield measurement. Insect damage assessed visually, Y indicates more than 25% loss of leaf area.
